# Rust WASI Example

A Rust/WASI example which compiles to target `wasm32-wasi` and demonstrates the use of `wasm-bindgen` with WasmerJS.

It imports and can call JavaScript from src/js-wasi and can be called from the application JavaScript using bindings generated by `wasm-bindgen`.

This is a component in a larger app, as demonstrated in https://github.com/happybeing/svelte-wasi-with-rust. See the main README or visit that project for more.
